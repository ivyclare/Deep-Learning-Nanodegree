As an avid sea-kayaker I stayed up till 330am to watch this hoping to get a glimpse of some hand-made \\'skin-boats\\'. The movie did not let me down. Any student of kayak/umiak construction should have a look-see here. (Note to fellow SKers: they appear to be using Norton Sound kayaks with single blade paddles).<br /><br />But the film went way beyond this admittedly narrow interest. Even though there were as others have noted some little back-shot-fakey-bits the movie has so much heart they are just a minor annoyance. It was (from this very amateur anthropologist\\'s viewpoint) probably the perfect time to make this movie. Early thirties: the \\'talkies\\' are so new that they (including Louie B. Mayer!) actually let the Inuit speak in their own tongue. And there is so much that was still, despite the infused melodrama, authentic. They are really whacking that polar bear, that whale and those caribou. A fifties version of this film would have been so cheesy with \\'stars\\', Technicolor, etc. to gum it up. The seventies version? Don\\'t even. A very good companion piece to this excellent movie is \"White shadows in the south seas\" (1928) Geograpically the mirror image to \"Eskimo\" it also deals with the relentless and profound disruption of Western culture/technology on an unsuspecting people.'"
